```

The project is in its initial state. No source code, build tooling, or configuration has been added yet.

## Development Setup

No dependencies or build steps are required at this time. Clone and begin adding project structure.

## Git Workflow

- **Primary branch**: `main`
- Feature branches should follow the pattern: `claude/<description>-<id>`
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Push with: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`

## Conventions to Follow

When adding code to this project, adhere to these principles:

- Keep the project structure simple and flat until complexity demands otherwise
- Add a `.gitignore` appropriate to the chosen language/framework early on
- Include configuration for linting and formatting from the start
- Write tests alongside new functionality
- Update this file as the project evolves (tech stack, commands, architecture)

## Notes for AI Assistants

- Read existing files before proposing changes
- Do not over-engineer — match the scope of the current project
- When the tech stack is established, update this document with:
  - Build/run/test commands
  - Directory layout and architecture
  - Code style and conventions
  - Environment setup instructions
